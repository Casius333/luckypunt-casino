architecture_decisions:
  game_provider_integration:
    location: "main project (luckypunt-casino)"
    rationale:
      - "Direct player-to-game interactions require low latency"
      - "Game state management belongs with player sessions"
      - "Wallet transactions need direct access to game events"
      - "Security best practices for game provider APIs"
    
    responsibilities:
      main_project:
        - "Game API integrations and endpoints"

      - "Admin dashboard manages configurations"
      - "Main project reads configurations for provider connections"
      - "Game transactions recorded in main project"
      - "Admin dashboard reads transaction data for reporting"
